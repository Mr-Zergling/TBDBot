##TBD Bot 2: Kotlin Boogaloo

A rewrite of TBDBot in Kotlin, because python gets hard to manage
as the size of the codebase increases.

A configuration json file is required in the working directory,
currently it must be named bot_config.json and contain

```json
{
  "apiToken": "<your API token here>"
}
```
